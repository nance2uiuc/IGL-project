\vspace{1ex}
\begin{itemize}
\item {[Definition]}: Let $S$ be a genus-$2$ surface with a base (fixed) point $p\in S$. Let $\gamma:[0,1]\to S$ be a closed oriented path on $S$ such that $\gamma(0)=\gamma(1)=p$. Then, a point-pushing homeomorphism obtained by the curve $\gamma([0,1])$ is a homeomorphism from $S$ to $S$ which can be obtained by pushing the base point $p$ along the curve $\gamma([0,1])$.
\item Example:
\item {[Theorem]}: Every point-pushing homeomorphism on a genus-$2$ surface with a base point $p\in S$ can be written as a composition of \textit{generating} point-pushing homeomorphisms (obtained by the following curves in the picture below) and their inverses.
\end{itemize}

\item {[Definition]}: 
\item Example:
\item {[Theorem]}: Every homeomorphism on a genus-$g$ surface can be written as a composition of \textit{generating} dehn-twists (obtained by the following curves in the picture below) and their inverses.
