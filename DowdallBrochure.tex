{\large $\cdot$ Motivating Idea of this Project}
\\

A closed curve $\gamma$ with a base point $p$ on a surface $S$ determines a natural homeomorphism on the surface $S\setminus\{p\}$.

{\large $\cdot$ Main Goal of this Project}
\\

Given a randomly chosen closed curve with a base point on a genus-$2$ surface, we measure its entropy and combinatorial complexity, and analyze their correlation.
\\

{\large $\cdot$ Description of Our Program}
\\

Our program would randomly choose a surface and a closed curve generated by some special curves on the surface, then calculate its dilatation number (topological entropy) and self-intersection number (combinatorial complexity).
